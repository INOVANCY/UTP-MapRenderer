# UTP Map Renderer

UTP Map Renderer offers a streamlined solution for generating 2D renderings (in PNG format) of your Minecraft map with ease. Say goodbye to the hassles of installing and using Dynmap; with UTP Map Renderer, you get a simple, functional, and reliable rendering in just two clicks.

## Installation

Due to specific imports within the plugin, a version tailored to each game version is required. Visit the releases section of this GitHub repository to locate the compatible version for your Minecraft server (1.18.1/.2, 1.19.0/.2/.3/.4, 1.20.2/.4).
- Download the plugin version corresponding to your Minecraft server version.
- Upload the plugin to your server's FTP.
- Ensure that WorldEdit is installed on your server.
- Restart your server.

That's it!

## Usage

- Equip yourself with the WorldEdit selection tool (//wand).
- Select the two diagonally opposite points of your map by left and right-clicking.
- Execute the command /utpmaprenderer.

Wait a moment - as quick as a blink - and it's done!
The PNG file of your map can be found in your FTP (/plugins/UTPMapRenderer/map-...png).
